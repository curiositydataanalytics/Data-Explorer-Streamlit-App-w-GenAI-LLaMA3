In this video, we walk through building a data explorer app that uses generative AI to extract insights from a dataset. We’ll integrate the Groq API to create a conversational interface powered by Meta’s Llama3 model. The chatbot will have three core features — Ask, Aggregate and Create - which allow users to extract insights, summarize data, and generate visualizations using Plotly.
